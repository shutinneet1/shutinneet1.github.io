        <p>Are you a new player to FGO and know nothing about the game? Well I'm not sure why you're here, but either way I'll offer some tips.</p>
        <p>Some general advice: classes such as Riders and archers will generate more stars. The more hits a servant has on a card, the more damage, NP gain, and stars they generate.</p>
        <p>And most importantly: Gacha rates are hell. Exploit friends for servants you need lol.</p>
